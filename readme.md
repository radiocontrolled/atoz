# A to Z Programme Listing 

## Setup
To run, download code and open index.html, or place the directory in your local hosting environment. 

## Note re: images
Programme images were not added as the <code>{recipe}</code> parameter for each image was not available.  

For example, if you take <a href="https://ibl.api.bbci.co.uk/ibl/v1/atoz/k/programmes"> programmes starting with the letter 'K'</a>, starting with the first image - <a href="http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/{recipe}/p02ldyrp.jpg"">http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/{recipe}/p02ldyrp.jpg"</a> - the image is not available. I have used a placeholder image in the meantime.
